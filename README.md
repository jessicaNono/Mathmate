# Tkinter Python Simple Calculator
###Goal

This is a Python program for a GUI Calculator made using the tkinter module.

###Description

The initial implementation supports basic arithmetic operations: addition ("+"), subtraction ("-"), multiplication ("*"), and division ("/").

But we've now enhanced the capabilities of this calculator:

Error Handling: The program checks the input fields to ensure validity. Currently, only numeric values are accepted for the entries. Any non-numeric entry will be flagged with an error.

Extended Operations: The calculator now also supports advanced operations such as exponentiation ("^"), square root ("âˆš"), modulo ("%"), and trigonometric functions ("sin", "cos", "tan").

Memory Functions: We've added memory functions to store, recall, add to, and subtract from a stored value.

Equation Solving: Users can input equations (e.g., quadratic equations) to get solutions.

Graph Plotting: The calculator also features a graph plotting capability. This allows users to visualize functions and understand how they behave across different values.

This enhanced calculator is not just a simple arithmetic tool, but also a comprehensive mathematical utility that can be used for various advanced calculations and analyses.
