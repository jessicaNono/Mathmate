# MathMate: A Comprehensive Mathematical Utility

## Goal
MathMate aims to be more than just a calculator. It's a comprehensive tool designed to assist users with both simple and complex mathematical operations, plot functions, and educate users about various mathematical operations.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the program:
```
python tkinterEx.py
```

## Features

### Already Implemented:
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: The program validates input fields to ensure numeric values.
- **Extended Operations**: Exponentiation, square root, modulo, and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
- **Memory Functions**: Store, recall, add to, and subtract from a stored value.
- **Equation Solving**: Input equations, such as quadratic equations, to obtain solutions.
- **Graph Plotting**: Visualize functions to understand their behavior across different values.

### To Be Implemented:
- **Tutorial Section**: Educate users about different mathematical operations.
- **Function Enhancements**: Improve the plotting capabilities and introduce 3D plots.
- **Additional Operations**: Integrate more complex mathematical operations.
